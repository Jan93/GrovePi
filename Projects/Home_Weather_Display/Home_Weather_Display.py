# Home_Weather_Display.py
#
# This is an project for using the Grove RGB LCD Display and the Grove DHT Sensor from the GrovePi starter kit
# 
# In this project, the Temperature and humidity from the DHT sensor is printed on the RGB-LCD Display
#
#
# Note the dht_sensor_type below may need to be changed depending on which DHT sensor you have:
#  0 - DHT11 - blue one - comes with the GrovePi+ Starter Kit
#  1 - DHT22 - white one, aka DHT Pro or AM2302
#  2 - DHT21 - black one, aka AM2301
#
# For more info please see: http://www.dexterindustries.com/forum/?topic=537-6c-displayed-in-home-weather-project/#post-4485
